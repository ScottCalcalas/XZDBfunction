\title{Prepare Local Working Folder With Example Files}
\usage{
xzdb.help()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the paths of the copied files.
}
\description{
Copies the example files bundled inside the package's internal
\verb{shinyapp/} directory into the user's current working directory.

This helper function is designed for \strong{new users} who want to quickly
review the protocol and example dataset metadata before running the
Genomic DB Browser manually.

It copies:
\itemize{
\item The \strong{\verb{datasets/}} folder (including all example datasets),
\item \strong{\verb{Datasets infomation.xlsx}} (example dataset information index),
\item \strong{\verb{Use protocol.docx}} (step-by-step usage guide).
}

These files help new users understand:
\itemize{
\item How dataset metadata should be formatted,
\item How to fill in \verb{Datasets infomation.xlsx} for their own datasets,
\item The recommended workflow described in the protocol.
}
}
\details{
After running this function, your working directory will contain:
\itemize{
\item A local copy of the \verb{datasets/} folder,
\item The example dataset information Excel file,
\item A protocol document explaining how to structure and use the database.
}

You can modify \strong{\verb{Datasets infomation.xlsx}} to include your own datasets:
\enumerate{
\item Open the file in Excel.
\item Add a new row for each dataset you want to index.
\item Set \code{DatasetName} to the exact filename (e.g., \code{"MyData.xlsx"}).
\item Set the sheet number/name in the \code{Sheet} column.
\item Save the file in the same folder.
}

When you run the Shiny application, the program will automatically
read this Excel file to index and process your datasets.
